<h1> DeepSEA Model (Pytorch)</h1>

1) DeepSEA model written in pytorch is trained on 10,000 DNA sequences. We can trained it on more sequences to increase the accuracy

2) You can access the data through link https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bd8UaAqWcxITkjnLqgiB0WcdSmaaZcBv. It contains 9 sequence files and corresponding 9 labels files. It also contains trained DeepSEA model.
